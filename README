The license I chose was the GNU GPLv3.  This means that I allow anyone to use my code or make derivative works of my code given that they do the same. 
I chose this license for this particular repository because I like the idea of free software and its movement. In this scenario, if I were to add code to this repository, it would be code which I think would be beneficial for others to work on, impove on, and use. Also because, well, who doesn't like things for free? I use free software all the time and it's good for me to return the favor.  It's a nice give and take system. 
However, that is not to say I don't agree with proprietary software. There is room for both.  If I were to spend years working on and developing a program, I would probably make it a proprietary software and copyright it and sell it.  This way, I would be compensated for the time, work, and creativity I put into the project.  It really just depends on the scenario.
I support the spread of information and would like to spark creativity in others.
